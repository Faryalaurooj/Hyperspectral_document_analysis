# Hyperspectral_document_analysis
In this repo, we will explore the strength of hyper spectral image analysis for identification of ink mismatch in a document
A hyperspectral cube from iVision HHID dataset is provided here. The document contains some handwritten text written using one or more pens of different brands. We were required to perform the following tasks:
a) Show the total number of bands available in the hyperspectral cube along with the starting and ending wavelength range.
b) Display the 1st, 30th, 60th and the last band of the hyperspectral image as separate grayscale images. (Total 4 images). Also explain the visual differences that you find in the greyscale images.
c) Plot the spectral responses of foreground (or text) pixels only against the wavelength or band numbers. (Wavelengths on x-axis, Reflectance of text pixels on y-axis). Explain the trend in the graph.
d) Use an appropriate pattern recognition method to detect the number of different inks present in the document. Discuss the strengths and weakness / limitations of your approach.
e) Use color-labeling to classify text written with different inks in the document.
